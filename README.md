# Cloud Developer 2022 - Market Price Handler Exercise

## Running the app
To run the app execute:

```
./gradlew clean run
```
## Running tests
Just
```
./gradlew clean test
```
would be enough.

## RFC
A lot of more stuff would be needed to ensure proper production-readiness (which I can discuss later)
but most of them are rather out of scope of this exercise hence they were omitted.
